Create a classification model to predict whether a person makes over $50k a year
Project Description:
Problem statement: Create a classification model to predict whether a person makes over $50k a
year
Context: This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry
Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics).
Dataset : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1keoZsPXTLq6Qjt7JoGECBmrykSgjhHTD/view?usp=sharing
Details of features:
The columns are described as follows:
• Age
• Workclass
• Fnlwgt
• Education
• education_num
• marital_status
• occupation
• relationship
• race
• sex
• capital_gain
• capital_loss
• hours_per_week
• native_country
• income

Steps to consider:
1)Rename the columns.
2)Remove handle null values (if any).
3)Split data into training and test data.
4)Apply the following models on the training dataset and generate the predicted value for the test
dataset
a) Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
b) Decision Tree
c) Random Forest Classifier
d) Logistic Regression
e) KNN Classifier
5)Predict the income for test data
6)Compute Confusion matrix and classification report for each of these models.
